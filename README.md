Capturing audio (.wav) from target using a link

![hello](https://github.com/H4ckethics138/SpyV-icE/blob/main/Screenshot%20From%202025-01-09%2015-42-17.png)

### How it works?

After the user grants microphone permissions, a website redirect button of your choice is released to distract the target while small audio files (about 4 seconds in wav format) are sent to the attacker.
It uses [Recorderjs], plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes 


### Features:

Port Forwarding using Serveo or Ngrok
